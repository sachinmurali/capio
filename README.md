# capio

The objective here is to create a Python app/script to process Capio's speech recognition results into a word document. 

In order to run the app, first create a virtual environment. You can create a virtual environment using the virtualenv library in Python:

`pip install virtualenv`

Activate the virtualenv:
`virtualenv venv`

`source venv/bin/activate`

Once you're in the virtualenv, install the requirements file - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Move to the `src` folder and run the flask app using the command `FLASK_APP=app.py flask run`
